            I am currently a Doctoral Researcher at Inria Centre at Université
            de Lorraine (LARSEN Team) under the supervision of Dr. Enrico
            Mingo-Hoffman. My research work focuses on combining model-based
            methods and machine learning for robotic motion planning and
            control.

            I graduated with a Diploma (Integrated MSc) from the Computer
            Engineering and Informatics Department at the University of Patras,
            Greece in June 2024. My diploma thesis, entitled "Motion Planning of
            Robotic Systems Using Numerical Methods" was co-supervised by Prof.
            Emmanouil Psarakis and Prof. Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis and
            involved generating complex trajectories for dynamical systems by
            formulating the motion planning task as a numerical optimisation
            problem.

            As a student, I was a member of the University of Patras Robotics
            Club, an interdisciplinary team of students aimed at designing and
            constructing small and medium size robots for various competitive
            scenarios. Working with the team provided me with useful insight on
            all aspects of robotic system design. Our robots have been awarded
            numerous times internationally.
