<p>I am currently a Doctoral Researcher at <a href='https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-universite-lorraine'>Inria Centre at Université de Lorraine</a> (<a href='https://team.inria.fr/larsen/'>LARSEN Team</a>) under the supervision of <a href='https://members.loria.fr/EMingoHoffman/'>Dr. Enrico Mingo-Hoffman</a>. My research work focuses on combining model-based methods and machine learning for robotic motion planning and control.</p>

<p>I graduated with a Diploma (Integrated MSc) from the <a href='https://www.ceid.upatras.gr'>Computer Engineering and Informatics Department</a> at the University of Patras, Greece in June 2024. My diploma thesis, entitled "Motion Planning of Robotic Systems Using Numerical Methods" was co-supervised by <a href='https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/personnel/psarakis-emmanoyil-2/'>Prof. Emmanouil Psarakis</a> and <a href='https://costashatz.github.io/'>Prof. Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis</a> and involved formulating the robotic motion planning problem as a numerical optimisation problem and generating complex motions for dynamical systems.</p>

<p>As a student, I was a member of the <a href='https://robotics-club.upatras.gr/'>University of Patras Robotics Club</a>, an interdisciplinary team of students aimed at designing and constructing small and medium size for various competitive scenarios. Working with the team provided me with useful insight on all aspects of robotic system design. Our robots have been awarded numerous times internationally.</p>
